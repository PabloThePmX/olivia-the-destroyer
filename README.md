# Olivia, the Destroyer
### Based in a real life event of what my girlfriend's cat, Olivia, did to my computer monitor... In this game you are the monitor, and you should just ${\color{red}RUN}$.
The game was originally made by our professor [Marcos Santos](https://github.com/profmarcossantos) and our task was to make some changes to the theme and some of the mechanics.

> The project was made by me, Pablo Sarturi (1136331) and my friend [MÃ¡rio Balen](https://github.com/Sckelic) (1136196) as a project for the subject of Computional Thinking for Computer Science.
